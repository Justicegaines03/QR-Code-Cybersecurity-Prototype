# QR Code Security Mobile Application with Intelligent Features

## 📌 Overview
This project addresses the increasing security vulnerabilities posed by malicious QR codes (Quishing attacks) on college campuses. Our intelligent QR code security application dynamically validates QR codes in real time, eliminating the need for manual pre-validation by IT teams.

Inspired by the **Waymo vs. Tesla** analogy in self-driving technology, our approach provides a **scalable, AI-driven security solution** for QR code scanning—empowering users to safely interact with QR codes without requiring extensive IT oversight.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
### 🔴 The Threat: Quishing Attacks  
- Attackers place **malicious QR codes** on walls, bulletin boards, pamphlets, and common campus locations.
- Unsuspecting users scan them, leading to phishing websites or malware-infected pages.

### 🛠️ Limitations of Current Solutions
- **ScanTrust & Similar Tools**  
  - Require IT teams to manually validate every QR code.  
  - Resource-intensive, **not scalable** for large campuses.  

- **Proposed Solution:**  
  - **AI-driven** and **real-time** validation of QR codes, similar to Tesla’s approach in self-driving technology.  
  - Eliminates dependency on pre-validation and manual IT intervention.

## ⚙️ How It Works
### 🛠️ **Workflow:**
1. **User scans a QR code** through the mobile app.  
2. The app **sends QR code data** to a secure backend server.  
3. The backend server **cross-references the QR code** against known threat databases.  
4. If flagged as **suspicious**, the user receives an **alert and security details**.  
5. If deemed **safe**, the user is **redirected to the intended destination**.
